## Refactoring Goal
**What needs to be refactored and why:**


## Current Code Issues
**Problems with the current implementation:**
- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Poor performance
- [ ] Hard to maintain
- [ ] Difficult to test
- [ ] Poor readability
- [ ] Other: 

## Target Files/Modules
**Code areas that need refactoring:**
- 
- 
- 

## Current Code
**Paste relevant code sections that need improvement:**
```
(paste current code here)
```

## Proposed Improvements
**Describe the refactoring approach:**


**Design patterns to apply (if any):**
- 

## Success Criteria
**The refactoring will be successful when:**
- [ ] Code is more readable and maintainable
- [ ] Performance is improved (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] No functionality is broken
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Other: 

## Constraints
**Important limitations:**
- [ ] Must maintain existing functionality
- [ ] Must maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Maintain or improve performance
- [ ] Other: 

## Testing Strategy
**How to ensure refactoring doesn't break anything:**
- [ ] Run existing unit tests
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Add new tests for edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Manual verification steps: 

## Code Quality Metrics
**Improvements to measure:**
- [ ] Reduce cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] Improve code coverage
- [ ] Reduce code duplication
- [ ] Better naming conventions
- [ ] Other metrics:
